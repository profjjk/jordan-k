        <p>Ever since I was a little boy I dreamed of being a web developer… and if you believe that, then I’ve got a
          bridge to sell you.</p>
        <p>In truth, my path to becoming a web developer has been a long and unpredictable journey. I was a psychologist
          who dreamt of being a pilot, a wunderlust-stricken English teacher, an insufficiently greedy investment advisor,
          and an automotive entrepreneur who thinks sinking money into cars is wasteful. It’s been quite the journey.</p>
        <p>For me, life hasn’t been a carefully orchestrated symphony of coordinated harmonies telling a single coherent
          story. My life’s soundtrack is more akin to jazz: largely improvised and full of off-beat rhythms and deliberate
          deviations in pitch. I seek to harness the chaotic beats of life to create something new and beautiful. It's
          that ability to improvise and discover interesting ideas that fuels my work as a web developer. I bring the full
          weight of my insatiable curiosity, globe-trotting experience, and multifaceted professionalism to bear in
          creating delightful and functional websites that are sure to please.</p>
